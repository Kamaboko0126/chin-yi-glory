Further northwest lies the Han River, a natural boundary between Taiping and the North District. Along its banks stands Lecheng Temple where the Hanxi Mazu accommodates and is designated as a Grade III historical site.",i="The area where the University is located was historically known as Pinglin, where lies lush green mountains inviting people’s contemplation. In the early years, the campus was surrounded by abundant bamboo groves, longan, and lychee trees, forming a somewhat remote and rustic agricultural settlement. When Chin-Yi was established in 1971, the population of Taiping was only 28,071. However, as the University flourished, the campus area rapidly transformed into a prime university town where the land is extremely valuable. Over two decades, Taiping’s population surged to 122,923 and exceeded 200,000 by the end of 2024, and this did not include the nearly 15,000 students, faculty, and staff who moved in and out of the University. Consequently, the landscape has undergone significant changes over time.",a="The Pinglin area was once a Japanese military base. After the Nationalist government relocated to Taiwan, it became a “New Recruit Training Center.” In 2007, President Chen Shui-Bian pledged to transfer twenty hectares of the site to Chin-Yi for campus expansion, a process completed in 2010. This made Chin-Yi the most comprehensive technological university in central Taiwan. Today, the campus preserves several historic buildings, including the “Zhongzheng Platform” for military training and the former “ammunition depot”, now the “Chin-Yi Creativity Base”, an experimental space for student creativity and business ventures. These sites are living history.",s="This scenic campus embodies pastoral charm.
