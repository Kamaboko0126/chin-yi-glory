const e="The significance of curating this online exhibition is that as National Chin-Yi University of Technology (Chin-Yi hereafter) approaches its centennial and our generation has long been swept away by the torrents of history, yet, the green hills remain, and the serene beauty of the MingSho Lake endures.",t="Around the Lunar New Year’s Eve in 2025, a series of earthquakes, both major and minor, struck Taiwan and evoked memories of the devastating “921 Earthquake” in 1999. Chin-Yi has been seriously devastated by this seismic event, with the Engineering Building completely leveled and both the teaching building and student dormitories reduced to ruins. Fortunately, a few of the historic buildings have withstood the test of the disaster.",i="A great university should accommodate esteemed scholars as well as ancient trees and historic buildings as tangible markers of its legacy. Yet, confronting the great nature, we can only remain humble. If even vast oceans can transform into mulberry fields, let alone a single small building. We are left with no choice but to turn to pen and paper to preserve these memories for future generations.",n="This is a decade-long project from 2013 to 2024 dedicated to capturing the evolving campus landscape of Chin-Yi through color paintings. After all, sixty-one artworks are entrusted to the “Cultural and Educational Foundation of Ming Chang and Kuo-hsiu Wang” for permanent preservation. During this period, the long-awaited “Chin-Yi Student Dormitory” finally came to completion after thirteen years of anticipation. The following year, though modest in scale, the MingSho Lake came to harmonize beautifully with the surrounding green hills. Regrettably, in 2024, the iconic Little White House, the administrative building at the heart of Chin-Yi Boulevard, was demolished. Fortunately, both Lu Jin-Long and Shih Shih-Yu chose this very structure as their primary sketch subject and thus ensure it continues to endure in another form.",o="Over the past decade, whenever the opportunity arose, we would invite Lu Jin-Long, Wu Qing-Chuan, and Shih Shih-Yu to picture Chin-Yi from diverse perspectives, space, and atmosphere to preserve its various charms. Through the artists’ unique viewpoints, mediums, and techniques, they adhered to a common principle, ensuring “recognizability”, particularly by selecting subjects that resonate with the shared memories of all Chin-Yi members. As a result, architectural landmarks such as Guo-Sho Building, the library, and the facades of various college buildings become the primary subjects of these works. However, the portrayal of the campus is not confined to aerial views; rather, it followed a dynamic spatial approach. This includes broad, map-like bird’s-eye views as well as private, lesser-known spaces such as winding pathways. Some functional areas such as student dormitories, Qing-Yong Building, sports fields, and even the First Bank ATM kiosk at the old campus entrance, a crucially economic resource for students, are carefully pictured.",a="The major collected artworks are led by the three artists. In addition, many students, under the guidance of Professor Shih Shih-Yu, actively participated in similar projects such as Cherishing Chin-Yi Memories, Painting Chin-Yi, and Chin-Yi’s Charm. Though they have different names, these projects share the same purpose. Numerous campus-themed design works were inspired. Unable to archive all the outstanding works due to limited fund, we commemorate them through photographs of the evaluation process instead. Here, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to Yang Xu-An, Lin Ji-Wei, Lu Wei-Ling, and all the students from the 10th to the 14th cohorts (2017–2021) of the Department of Cultural and Creative Industries who contributed to these courses.",s="At last, and most importantly, the Author once again would pay tribute to friends of Lu Jin-Long, Wu Qing-Chuan, and Shih Shih-Yu. Having immersed myself in the art world for over two decades, I am well aware of the value systems that govern the art market. And yet, I did not hesitate to make this request of them, precisely because of our shared values and mutual understanding. Confronting the fleeting nature of worldly achievements, what truly matters is what we could leave behind in the currents of history? Even now, Lu Jin-Long still asks me, “May I redraw this”? This is indeed the spirit of self-surpassing.",r="While National Chin-Yi University of Technology continues to strive forward, those of us who have dedicated our lives to this campus will inevitably fade away, one by one. What I wonder is how to utilize painting brushes as the historian’s pens to preserve the current campus for future remembrance.",h="Caption: The Engineering Building, originally located on the lawn in front of the Qing-Yong Building.",u="Caption: Its appearance after being leveled by the 921 Earthquake.",c="Caption: At the private school period, large metal tea barrels were placed along the corridor railings of the teaching building every night for evening class students.
